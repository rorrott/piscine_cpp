# C++ Piscine (Modules 00–09)

The C++ Piscine is a series of projects at 42 School designed to introduce students to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the fundamentals of modern C++.

Across 10 modules (00 → 09), the curriculum covers core concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, memory management, and advanced C++ features.

This repository contains my solutions for all the C++ modules, implemented in compliance with the 42 Norms.

## Modules Overview

- Module 00 → Basics of C++ (namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio vs iostream)

- Module 01 → Memory allocation, references, and pointers to members

- Module 02 → Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, Orthodox Canonical Form

- Module 03 → Inheritance

- Module 04 → Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces

- Module 05 → Exceptions and error handling

- Module 06 → C++ casts (static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, const_cast)

- Module 07 → Templates

- Module 08 → Templated containers, iterators, algorithms

- Module 09 → Standard containers, advanced algorithmic problems (e.g. RPN, PmergeMe)

## Key Concepts Learned

- Object-Oriented Programming principles

- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

- Memory management & RAII

- Exception handling

- Templates and generic programming

- Standard Template Library (STL) basics

## Project Rules (42)

- Written in C++98 standard

- Must follow 42 Norminette guidelines (adapted for C++)

- No use of banned functions/libraries

- Focused on clean OOP design and best practices
